Hey! Thanks for downloading this!
cookieCutter.lua is an open source programming language,
made entirely in Lua!

It's made to be compatible with
lua 5.1.4 to lua 5.2

All contributions are welcomed,
and I'm hoping this can be as simple as it has to be,
because I want this to be educational for everyone who wants to make a language

I also want to make a series on youtube about it,
after I'm done with this,
since there's literally no good tutorials anywhere on the topic

improvements to the code are very welcomed

also, s.lua is to make it easier for me to start it during testing :P
